## Hello World

Welcome to my corner of the internet. After years of using various platforms and templates, I decided to build something that truly represents who I am—a developer who appreciates both the elegance of classic interfaces and the power of modern web technologies.

### The Inspiration

I've always been fascinated by **Terminal User Interfaces**. There's something deeply satisfying about their efficiency, their focus on content over chrome, and their timeless aesthetic. At the same time, I wanted the readability and scholarly feel of Wikipedia—a site that prioritizes information density without sacrificing legibility.

The result is what you see here: a fusion of monospace UI elements with serif typography for content. It's deliberately different from the typical modern web aesthetic, and I love it.

### The Tech Stack

This site is built with technologies I genuinely enjoy working with:

- **SvelteKit** — For its elegant reactivity model and excellent developer experience
- **MDX via mdsvex** — Write content in Markdown, sprinkle in components when needed
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling that doesn't get in the way
- **TypeScript** — Because type safety is a form of documentation

### What's Next

I plan to write about:

1. Deep dives into web development patterns
2. Lessons learned from production systems
3. Explorations of interesting technologies
4. Personal projects and their technical challenges
