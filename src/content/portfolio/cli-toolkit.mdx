## CLI Toolkit

A growing collection of command-line utilities designed to solve everyday developer annoyances. Built in Rust for speed and reliability, with a focus on ergonomic interfaces.

### Motivation

I found myself repeatedly writing bash one-liners for common tasks—comparing environment files, formatting JSON, searching git history. Each script worked, but they were slow, inconsistent, and hard to remember.

This toolkit consolidates those utilities into fast, well-documented commands with consistent interfaces.

### Tools Included

#### `envdiff` — Environment File Comparison

Compare `.env` files across environments, highlighting differences:

```bash
$ envdiff .env.local .env.production

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Environment Comparison                       │
├─────────────┬──────────────┬────────────────┤
│ Key         │ .env.local   │ .env.production│
├─────────────┼──────────────┼────────────────┤
│ DATABASE_URL│ localhost:5432│ db.prod:5432  │
│ DEBUG       │ true         │ (missing)      │
│ API_KEY     │ dev_xxx      │ prod_xxx       │
└─────────────┴──────────────┴────────────────┘
```

Features:
- Detects missing keys in either file
- Masks sensitive values with `--redact` flag
- Outputs in JSON, table, or diff format

#### `jf` — JSON Formatter & Validator

A faster alternative to `jq` for common operations:

```bash
# Pretty print
$ cat data.json | jf

# Minify
$ jf -m data.json

# Validate and report errors
$ jf --validate api-response.json
✓ Valid JSON (324 objects, 2.1 KB)

# Extract field
$ jf '.users[0].name' data.json
```

Benchmarks show 3-5x speed improvement over `jq` for large files.

#### `gf` — Git Fuzzy Finder

Interactive git operations with fuzzy search:

```bash
# Fuzzy switch branch
$ gf branch
> feature/   # Type to filter
  feature/auth-system
  feature/dashboard
  feature/api-v2

# Fuzzy checkout commit
$ gf log
> fix       # Search commit messages
  a]2f4d - fix: resolve auth bug
  c8e1a - fix: correct typo in readme

# Interactive stash management
$ gf stash
```

### Architecture

```
cli-toolkit/
├── crates/
│   ├── envdiff/      # Environment comparison
│   ├── jf/           # JSON formatter
│   ├── gf/           # Git fuzzy finder
│   └── shared/       # Common utilities
├── Cargo.toml        # Workspace config
└── README.md
```

Each tool is a separate crate, sharing common code for:
- Terminal colors and formatting
- Configuration file handling
- Error messages and help text

### Technical Highlights

**Zero-copy JSON parsing** — The `jf` tool uses `simd-json` for SIMD-accelerated parsing, processing files without unnecessary allocations.

**Async git operations** — `gf` uses async Rust to query git in parallel, making branch/commit listing instant even in large repositories.

**Cross-platform** — All tools work on Linux, macOS, and Windows with native terminal support.

### Installation

```bash
# From crates.io
cargo install cli-toolkit

# From source
git clone https://github.com/username/cli-toolkit
cd cli-toolkit
cargo install --path .
```

### What I Learned

- Rust's CLI ecosystem (clap, crossterm) is remarkably mature
- Small tools benefit enormously from good defaults
- Performance matters—fast tools get used more often
- Writing documentation forces you to simplify interfaces
