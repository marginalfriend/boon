## Personal Website

The site you're currently viewing. A deliberate departure from conventional web design, blending the efficiency of Terminal User Interfaces with the readability of traditional encyclopedic layouts.

### Design Philosophy

Most personal websites follow predictable patterns—hero sections, card grids, gradient backgrounds. I wanted something different: a design that reflects my appreciation for command-line interfaces while remaining accessible to everyone.

**Key design decisions:**

- **Dual typography** — Monospace (`IBM Plex Mono`) for UI elements, Serif (`Crimson Pro`) for content
- **Dark terminal palette** — Easy on the eyes, reminiscent of late-night coding sessions
- **Box-drawing aesthetics** — Subtle nods to TUI frameworks like `ncurses`
- **Wikipedia-style content** — Section markers, justified text, and information density

### Technical Implementation

#### Content Management with MDX

All content is written in MDX files with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
date: "2026-01-18"
description: "Brief description"
---

Content goes here with **full Markdown** support.
```

The build system uses `mdsvex` to process MDX files, extracting metadata and rendering content as Svelte components.

#### Type-Safe Content Loading

```typescript
export async function getBlogPosts(): Promise<BlogPost[]> {
  const modules = import.meta.glob("/src/content/blogs/*.mdx", {
    eager: true,
    import: "metadata",
  });
  // ... process and return typed posts
}
```

#### Responsive TUI Frame

The terminal-style frame adapts gracefully:

- Full decorative borders on desktop
- Simplified borders on mobile
- Content always remains readable

### Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Making box-drawing characters align with CSS borders.

**Solution:** Used CSS-only approach with pseudo-elements for decorative lines, avoiding pixel-perfect character alignment issues.

**Challenge:** Balancing terminal aesthetics with accessibility.

**Solution:** Maintained proper contrast ratios, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation despite the unconventional visual design.

### Performance

- **Static generation** — All pages pre-rendered at build time
- **Minimal JavaScript** — Svelte's compilation approach means tiny bundles
- **No external fonts blocking render** — Font loading optimized with `display: swap`

### What I Learned

Building this site reinforced several principles:

1. Constraints breed creativity—the TUI limitation led to interesting solutions
2. Typography matters more than graphics for content-focused sites
3. Static site generators have come remarkably far
4. Writing about your work forces you to understand it better
