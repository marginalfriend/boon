## Mekari Expense

A comprehensive expense management solution I contributed to at Mekari, serving thousands of Indonesian businesses in managing corporate spending, reimbursements, and financial compliance.

### My Role

As a front-end engineer on the Expense team, I worked on:

- **Expense submission flows** — Multi-step forms with receipt scanning
- **Approval workflows** — Configurable approval chains with delegation
- **Reporting dashboards** — Data visualization for finance teams
- **Mobile responsiveness** — Ensuring functionality across devices

### Technical Challenges

#### Complex Form State

Expense submissions involve multiple steps, file uploads, currency conversions, and policy validations. We built a form architecture that:

- Persists draft state across sessions
- Validates against company policies in real-time
- Handles offline receipt capture with sync

```typescript
// Simplified expense form state machine
type ExpenseFormState =
  | { step: 'category'; data: CategorySelection }
  | { step: 'details'; data: ExpenseDetails }
  | { step: 'receipts'; data: ReceiptUpload[] }
  | { step: 'review'; data: CompleteExpense }
  | { step: 'submitted'; id: string };
```

#### Real-time Policy Validation

Expenses must comply with company policies—per-diem limits, category restrictions, required approvers. We implemented client-side policy evaluation that provides instant feedback:

```typescript
interface PolicyViolation {
  rule: string;
  severity: 'warning' | 'error';
  message: string;
  suggestion?: string;
}

function validateExpense(
  expense: Expense,
  policies: CompanyPolicies
): PolicyViolation[] {
  // Real-time validation against configurable rules
}
```

#### Optimistic UI for Approvals

Managers often approve expenses in batches. We implemented optimistic updates to make the approval flow feel instant:

1. Immediately update UI on approval click
2. Send request to server
3. Roll back if server rejects (rare)
4. Sync final state when response arrives

### Performance Optimizations

**Challenge:** Dashboard with 10,000+ expense records was slow.

**Solution:**
- Virtual scrolling for expense lists
- Pagination with cursor-based API
- Memoized aggregation calculations
- Service worker caching for repeat visits

**Result:** Initial load time reduced from 4.2s to 1.1s.

### Design System Contribution

We maintained a shared component library across Mekari products. My contributions included:

- Data table component with sorting, filtering, and selection
- Currency input with locale-aware formatting
- File upload with drag-and-drop and progress indicators

### Impact

- Processed **$50M+** in expenses monthly
- Reduced average reimbursement time from 14 days to 3 days
- **4.5/5** user satisfaction rating
- Adopted by 2,000+ companies

### What I Learned

Working on enterprise software taught me:

1. **Edge cases are the norm** — Every company has unique policies and workflows
2. **Performance is a feature** — Finance teams process hundreds of items daily
3. **Accessibility matters** — Screen reader support isn't optional
4. **Documentation saves time** — Future you will thank present you

Building software that handles real money for real businesses brings a healthy respect for testing, error handling, and user feedback.
